name: Short integration tests

# Run the integration tests on one configuration (of the nightly matrix) on each
# push to main. Should catch 95% of integration test breakages. Useful for
# identifying the particular offending commit and emailing the commit author.

# Note: currently the integration tests don't take that long to run (<1 min).
# If, in the future, they take significantly longer (>~1 hour), we should
# reconsider this.
