# FIRRTL Dialect Rationale

This document describes various design points of the FIRRTL dialect, why it is
the way it is, and current status and progress.  This follows in the spirit of
other [MLIR Rationale docs](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Rationale/).

## Introduction

[The FIRRTL project](https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl) is an existing
open source compiler infrastructure used by the Chisel framework to lower ".fir"
files to Verilog.  It provides a number of useful compiler passes and
infrastructure that allows the development of domain specific passes.  The
FIRRTL project includes a [well documented IR
specification](https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl/blob/master/spec/spec.pdf)
that explains the semantics of its IR, an [ANTLR
grammar](https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl/blob/master/src/main/antlr4/FIRRTL.g4)
includes some extensions beyond it, and a compiler implemented in Scala which we
refer to as the _Scala FIRRTL Compiler_ (SFC).

_The FIRRTL dialect in CIRCT is designed to provide a drop-in replacement for
the SFC for the subset of FIRRTL IR that is produced by Chisel and in common
use._  The FIRRTL dialect also provides robust support for SFC _Annotations_.

To achieve these goals, the FIRRTL dialect follows the FIRRTL IR specification
and the SFC implementation almost exactly.  The small deviations we do make are
discussed below.  Early versions of the FIRRTL dialect made _heavy deviations_
from FIRRTL IR and the SFC (see the Type Canonicalization section below).  These
deviations, while elegant, led to difficult to resolve mismatches with the SFC
and the inability to verify FIRRTL IR.  The remaining small deviations
introduced in the FIRRTL dialect are done to simplify the CIRCT implementation
of a FIRRTL compiler and to take advantage of MLIR's various features.

This document generally assumes that you've read and have a basic grasp of the
FIRRTL IR spec, and it can be occasionally helpful to refer to the ANTLR
grammar.

## Status

The FIRRTL dialect and FIR parser is a generally complete implementation of the
FIRRTL specification and is actively maintained, tracking new enhancements. The
FIRRTL dialect supports some undocumented features and the "CHIRRTL" flavor of
FIRRTL IR that is produced from Chisel.  The FIRRTL dialect has support for
parsing an SFC Annotation file consisting of only local annotations and
converting this to operation or argument attributes.  Non-local annotation
support is planned, but not implemented.

There are some exceptions to the above:

1) We don't support the `'raw string'` syntax for strings.
2) We don't support the `Fixed` types for fixed point numbers, and some
   primitives associated with them.
3) We don't support `Interval` types

Some of these may be research efforts that didn't gain broad adoption, in which
case we don't want to support them.  However, if there is a good reason and a
community that would benefit from adding support for these, we can do so.

## Naming

One of the goals of the FIRRTL compiler is to produce human-readable Verilog
which can be easily mapped back to the input FIRRTL. Part of this effort
means that we want the naming of Verilog objects to match the names used in
the original FIRRTL, and they are predictably transformed during lowering.
For example, after bundles are replaced with scalars in the lower-types pass,
each field should be prefixed with the bundle name:

```scala
circuit Example
  module Example
    reg myreg: { a :UInt<1>, b: UInt<1> }, clock
; firrtl-lower-types =>
circuit Example
  module Example
    reg myreg_a: UInt<1>, clock
    reg myreg_b: UInt<1>, clock
```

The name transformations applied by the SFC have become part of the
documented API, and people rely on the final names to take a certain form.

There are names for temporaries generated by the Chisel and FIRRTL tooling
which are not important to maintain. These names are discarded when parsing,
which saves memory during compilation. New names are generated at Verilog
export time, which has the effect of renumbering intermediate value names.
Names generated by Chisel typically look like `_T_12`, and names generated by
the SFC look like `_GEN_12`. The FIRRTL compiler will not discard these names
if the object has an array attribute `annotations` containing the attribute
`{class = "firrtl.transforms.DontTouchAnnotation}`.

It is common for EDA tools to hide or optimize away entities which have a
name beginning with an `_`. FIRRTL considers these names precious (excluding
FIRRTL temporary names) and will maintain them.

## Type system

### Not using standard types

At one point we tried to use the integer types in the standard dialect, like
`si42` instead of `!firrtl.sint<42>`, but we backed away from this.  While it
originally seemed appealing to use those types, FIRRTL
operations generally need to work with "unknown width" integer types (i.e.
`!firrtl.sint`).

Having the known width and unknown width types implemented with two different
C++ classes was awkward, led to casting bugs, and prevented having a
`FIRRTLType` class that unified all the FIRRTL dialect types.

### Not Canonicalizing Flip Types

An initial version of the FIRRTL dialect relied on canonicalization of flip
types according to the following rules:

1) `flip(flip(x))` == `x`.
2) `flip(analog(x))` == `analog(x)` since analog types are implicitly
    bidirectional.
3) `flip(bundle(a,b,c,d))` == `bundle(flip(a), flip(b), flip(c), flip(d))` when
   the bundle has non-passive type or contains an analog type.  This forces the
   flip into the subelements, where it recursively merges with the non-passive
   subelements and analogs.
4) `flip(vector(a, n))` == `vector(flip(a), n)` when the vector has non-passive
   type or analogs.  This forces the flip into the element type, generally
   canceling it out.
5) `bundle(flip(a), flip(b), flip(c), flip(d))` == `flip(bundle(a, b, c, d)`.
   Due to the other rules, the operand to a flip must be a passive type, so the
   entire bundle will be passive, and rule #3 won't be recursively reinvoked.

While elegant in a number of ways (e.g., FIRRTL types are guaranteed to have a
canonical representation and can be compared using pointer equality, flips
partially subsume port directionality and "flow", and analog inputs and outputs
are canonicalized to the same representation), this resulted in information loss
during canonicalization because the number of flip types can change.  Namely,
three problems were identified:

1) Type canonicalization may make illegal operations legal.
2) The flow of connections could not be verified because flow is a function of
   the number of flip types.
3) The directionality of leaves in an aggregate could not be determined.

As an example of the first problem, consider the following circuit:

``` scala
module Foo:
  output a: { flip a: UInt<1> }
  output b: { a: UInt<1> }

  b <= a
```

The connection `b <= a` _is illegal_ FIRRTL due to a type mismatch where `{ flip
a: UInt<1> }` is not equal to `{ a: UInt<1> }`.  However, type canonicalization
would transform this circuit into the following circuit:

```scala
module Foo:
  input a: { a: UInt<1> }
  output b: { a: UInt<1> }

  b <= a
```

Here, the connection `b <= a` _is legal_ FIRRTL.  This then makes it impossible
for a type canonical form to be type checked.

As an example of the second problem, consider the following circuit:

```scala
module Bar:
  output a: { flip a: UInt<1> }
  input b: { flip b: UInt<1> }

  b <= a
```

Here, the connection `b <= a` _is illegal_ FIRRTL because `b` is a source and
`a` is a sink.  However, type canonicalization converts this to the following
circuit:

``` scala
module Bar:
  input a: { a: UInt<1> }
  output b: { b: UInt<1> }

  b <= a
```

Here, the connect `b <= a` _is legal_ FIRRTL because `b` is now a sink and `a`
is now a source.  This then makes it impossible for a type canonical form to be
flow checked.

As an example of the third problem, consider the following circuit:

``` scala
module Baz:
  wire a: {flip a: {flip a: UInt<1>}}
  wire b: {flip a: {flip a: UInt<1>}}

  b.a <= a.a
```

The connection `b.a <= a.a`, when lowered, results in the _reverse_ connect
`a.a.a <= b.a.a`.  However, type canonicalization will remove the flips from the
circuit to produce:

```scala
module Baz:
  wire a: {a: {a: UInt<1>}}
  wire b: {a: {a: UInt<1>}}

  b.a <= a.a
```

Here, the connect `b.a <= a.a`, when lowered, results in the normal connect
`b.a.a <= a.a.a`.  Type canonicalization has thereby changed the semantics of
connect.

Due to the elegance of type canonicalization, we initially decided that we would
use type canonicalization and CIRCT would accept more circuits than the SFC.
The third problem (identified much later than the first two) convinced us to
remove type canonicalization.

For a historical discussion of type canonicalization see:

- [`llvm/circt#380`](https://github.com/llvm/circt/issues/380)
- [`llvm/circt#919`](https://github.com/llvm/circt/issues/919)
- [`llvm/circt#944`](https://github.com/llvm/circt/pull/944)

### Flow

The FIRRTL specification describes the concept of "flow".  Flow encodes
additional information that determines the legality of operations.  FIRRTL
defines three different flows: `sink`, `source`, and `duplex`.  Module inputs,
instance outputs, and nodes are `source`, module outputs and instance inputs are
`sink`, and wires and registers are `duplex`.  A value with `sink` flow may only
be written to, but not read from (with the exception of module outputs and
instance inputs which may be also read from).  A value with `source` flow may be
read from, but not written to.  A value with `duplex` flow may be read from or
written to.

For FIRRTL connects or partial connect statements, it follows that the
left-hand-side must be `sink` or `duplex` and the right-hand-side must be
`source`, `duplex`, or a port/instance `sink`.

Flow is _not_ represented as a first-class type in CIRCT.  We instead provide
utilities for computing flow when needed, e.g., for connect statement
verification.

## Operations

### Multiple result `firrtl.instance` operation

The FIRRTL spec describes instances as returning a bundle type, where each
element of the bundle corresponds to one of the ports of the module being
instanced.  This makes sense in the Scala FIRRTL implementation, given that it
does not support multiple ports.

The MLIR FIRRTL dialect takes a different approach, having each element of the
bundle result turn into its own distinct result on the `firrtl.instance`
operation.  This is made possible by MLIR's robust support for multiple value
operands, and makes the IR much easier to analyze and work with.

### Module bodies require def-before-use dominance instead of allowing graphs

MLIR allows regions with arbitrary graphs in their bodies, and this is used by
the RTL dialect to allow direct expression of cyclic graphs etc.  While this
makes sense for hardware in general, the FIRRTL dialect is intended to be a
pragmatic infrastructure focused on lowering of Chisel code to the RTL dialect,
it isn't intended to be a "generally useful IR for hardware".

We recommend that non-Chisel frontends target the RTL dialect, or a higher level
dialect of their own creation that lowers to RTL as appropriate.

### `input` and `output` Module Ports

The FIRRTL specification describes two kinds of ports: `input` and `output`.  In
the `firrtl.module` declaration we track this via an arbitrary precision integer
attribute (`IntegerAttr`) where each bit encodes the directionality of the port
at that index.

Originally, we encoded direction as the absence of an outer flip type (input) or
presence of an outer flip type (output).  This was done as part of the original
type canonicalization effort which combined input/output with the type system.
However, once type canonicalization was removed flip type only became used in
three places: on the types of bundle fields, on the variadic return types of
instances or memories, and on ports.  The first is the same as the FIRRTL
specification.  The second is a deviation from the FIRRTL specification, but
allowable as it takes advantage of the MLIR's variadic capabilities to simplify
the IR.  The third was an inelegant abuse of an unrelated concept that added
bloat to the type system.  Many operations would have to check for an outer flip
on ports and immediately discard it.

For this reason, the `IntegerAttr` encoding implementation was chosen.

For a historical discussion of this issue and its development see:

- [`llvm/circt#989`](https://github.com/llvm/circt/issues/989)
- [`llvm/circt#992`](https://github.com/llvm/circt/pull/992)

### `firrtl.mem`

Unlike the SFC, the FIRRTL dialect represents each memory port as a distinct
result value of the `firrtl.mem` operation.  Also, the `firrtl.mem` node does
not allow zero port memories for simplicity.  Zero port memories are dropped
by the .fir file parser.

### More things are represented as primitives

We describe the `mux` expression as "primitive", whereas the IR
spec and grammar implement it as a special kind of expression.

We do this to simplify the implementation: These expressions
have the same structure as primitives, and modeling them as such allows reuse
of the parsing logic instead of duplication of grammar rules.

### `invalid` Invalidate Operation is an expression

The FIRRTL spec describes an `x is invalid` statement that logically computes
an invalid value and connects it to `x` according to flow semantics.  This
behavior makes analysis and transformation a bit more complicated, because there
are now two things that perform connections: `firrtl.connect` and the
`x is invalid` operation.

To make things easier to reason about, we split the `x is invalid` operation
into two different ops: an `firrtl.invalidvalue` op that takes no operands
and returns an invalid value, and a standard `firrtl.connect` operation that
connects the invalid value to the destination (or a `firrtl.attach` for analog
values).  This has the same expressive power as the standard FIRRTL
representation but is easier to work with.

During parsing, we break up an `x is invalid` statement into leaf connections.
As an example, consider the following FIRRTL module where a bi-directional
aggregate, `a` is invalidated:

``` scala
module Foo:
  output a: { a: UInt<1>, flip b: UInt<1> }

  a is invalid
```

This is parsed into the following MLIR.  Here, only `a.a` is invalidated:

``` mlir
firrtl.module @Foo(out %a: !firrtl.bundle<a: uint<1>, b: flip<uint<1>>>) {
  %0 = firrtl.subfield %a("a") : (!firrtl.bundle<a: uint<1>, b: flip<uint<1>>>) -> !firrtl.uint<1>
  %invalid_ui1 = firrtl.invalidvalue : !firrtl.uint<1>
  firrtl.connect %0, %invalid_ui1 : !firrtl.uint<1>, !firrtl.uint<1>
}
```

### `validif` represented as a multiplexer

The FIRRTL spec describes a `validIf(en, x)` operation that is used during lowering from high to low FIRRTL. Consider the following example:

```scala
c <= invalid
when a:
  c <= b
```

Lowering will introduce the following intermediate representation in low FIRRTL:

```scala
c <= validIf(a, b)
```

Since there is no precedence of this `validIf` being used anywhere in the Chisel/FIRRTL ecosystem thus far and instead is always replaced by its right-hand operand `b`, the FIRRTL MLIR dialect does not provide such an operation at all. Rather it directly replaces any `validIf` in FIRRTL input with the following equivalent operations:

```mlir
%0 = firrtl.invalidvalue : !firrtl.uint<42>
%c = firrtl.mux(%a, %b, %0) : (!firrtl.uint<1>, !firrtl.uint<42>, !firrtl.uint<42>) -> !firrtl.uint<42>
```

A canonicalization then folds this combination of `firrtl.invalidvalue` and `firrtl.mux` to the "high" operand of the multiplexer to facilitate downstream transformation passes.

## Annotations

The SFC provides a mechanism to encode arbitrary metadata and associate it with
zero or more "things" in a FIRRTL circuit.  This mechanism is an _Annotation_
and the association is described using one or more _Targets_.  Annotations are
serializable to JSON and either live in a separate file (e.g., during the
handoff between Chisel and the SFC) or are stored in-memory (e.g., during
SFC-based compilation).  The SFC pass API requires that passes describe which
targets in the circuit they update.  SFC infrastructure then automatically
updates annotations so they are always synchronized with their corresponding
FIRRTL IR.

Historically, annotations grew out of three choices in the design of FIRRTL IR:

1) FIRRTL IR is not extensible with user-defined IR nodes.
2) FIRRTL IR is not parameterized.
3) FIRRTL IR does not support in-IR attributes.

Annotations have then been used for all manner of extensions including:

1) Encoding SystemVerilog nodes into the IR using special printfs, an example of
   working around (1) above.
2) Setting the reset vector of different, identical CPU cores, an example of
   working around (2) above.
3) Encoding sources and sinks that should be wired together by an SFC pass, an
   example of (3) above.

### Targets

A target is a special identifier of the form:

```
“~” (circuit) (“|” (module) (“/” (instance) “:” (module) )* (“>” (reference) )?)?
```

A reference is a name inside a module and one or more qualifying tokens that
encode subfields (of a bundle) or subindices (of a vector):

```
(name) ("[" (index) "]" | "." (field))*
```

To show some examples of what these look like, consider the following example
circuit. This consists of four instances of module `Baz`, two instances of
module `Bar`, and one instance of module `Foo`:

```scala
circuit Foo:
  module Baz:
    skip
  module Bar:
    inst c of Baz
    inst d of Baz
  module Foo:
    inst a of Bar
    inst b of Bar
```

Using targets (or multiple targets), any specific module, instance, or
combination of instances can be expressed. Some examples include:

- `~Foo` refers to the whole circuit
- `~Foo|Foo` refers to the top module
- `~Foo|Bar` refers to module `Bar` (or both instances of module `Bar`)
- `~Foo|Foo/a:Bar` refers just to one instance of module `Bar`
- `~Foo|Foo/b:Bar/c:Baz` refers to one instance of module `Baz`
- `~Foo|Bar/d:Baz` refers to two instances of module `Baz`

If a target does not contain an instance path, it is a _local_ target.  A local
target points to all instances of a module.  If a target contains an instance
path, it is a _non-local_ target.  A non-local target _may_ not point to all
instances of a module.  Additionally, a non-local target may have an equivalent
local target representation.

### CIRCT Support

We plan to provide full support for annotations in CIRCT.  The FIRRTL dialect
current supports:

1) All non-local annotations can be parsed and applied to the correct circuit
   component.
2) Annotations, with and without references, are copied to the correct ground
   type in the `LowerTypes` pass.

Annotations can be parsed using the `--annotation-file` command line argument to
the `firtool` utility.  Alternatively, we provide a non-standard way of encoding
annotations in the FIRRTL IR textual representation.  We provide this
non-standard support primarily to make test writing easier.  As an example of
this, consider the following JSON annotation file:

```json
[
  {
    "target": "~Foo|Foo",
    "hello": "world"
  }
]
```

This can be equivalently, in CIRCT, expressed as:

``` scala
circuit Foo: %[[{"target":"~Foo|Foo","hello":"world"}]]
  module Foo:
    skip
```

During parsing, annotations are "scattered" into the MLIR representation as
operation or argument attributes.  As an example of this, the above parses into
the following MLIR representation:

```mlir
firrtl.circuit "Foo"  {
  firrtl.module @Foo() attributes {annotations = [{hello = "world"}]} {
    firrtl.skip
  }
}
```

Targets without references have their targets stripped during scattering since
target information is redundant once annotation metadata is attached to the IR.
Targets with references have the reference portion of the target included in the
attribute.  The `LowerTypes` pass then uses this reference information to attach
annotation metadata to only the _lowered_ portion of a targeted circuit
component.

Annotations are expected to be fully removed via custom transforms, conversion
to other MLIR operations, or dropped.  E.g., the `ModuleInliner` pass removes
`firrtl.passes.InlineAnnotation` by inlining annotated modules or instances.
