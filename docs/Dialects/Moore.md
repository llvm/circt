# 'moore' Dialect

This dialect provides operations and types to capture a SystemVerilog design after parsing, type checking, and elaboration.

[TOC]


## Rationale

The main goal of the `moore` dialect is to provide a set of operations and types for the `ImportVerilog` conversion to translate a fully parsed, type-checked, and elaborated Slang AST into MLIR operations. See IEEE 1800-2017 for more details about SystemVerilog. The dialect aims to faithfully capture the full SystemVerilog types and semantics, and provide a platform for transformation passes to resolve language quirks, analyze the design at a high level, and lower it to the core dialects.

In contrast, the `sv` dialect is geared towards emission of SystemVerilog text, and is focused on providing a good lowering target to allow for emission. The `moore` and `sv` dialect may eventually converge into a single dialect. As we are building out the Verilog frontend capabilities of CIRCT it is valuable to have a separate ingestion dialect, such that we do not have to make disruptive changes to the load-bearing `sv` dialect used in production.

## LRM Rules
### Unconnection rules
The SystemVerilog LRM defines unconnected behavior while leaving ports unconnected.

| Port Type        | Unconnected Behavior       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Input (Net)      | High-impedance value ('Z)  |
| Input (Variable) | Default initial value      |
| Output           | No effect on Simulation    |
| Inout (Net)      | High-impedance value ('Z)  |
| Inout (Variable) | Default initial value      |
| Ref              | Cannot be left unconnected |
| Interconnect     | Cannot be left unconnected |
| Interface        | Cannot be left unconnected |

For variables that do not have a specified initializer. It has a default rule to initialize data value according to its type:

| Type                        | Default initial value           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 4-state integral            | 'X                              |
| 2-state integral            | '0                              |
| **real**, **shortreal**     | 0.0                             |
| Enumeration                 | Base type default initial value |
| **string**                  | "" (empty string)               |
| **event**                   | New event                       |
| **class**                   | **null**                        |
| **interface class**         | **null**                        |
| **chandle (Opaque handle)** | **null**                        |
| **virtual interface**       | **null**                        |

## Types

### Simple Bit Vector Type

The `moore.iN` and `moore.lN` types represent a two-valued or four-valued simple bit vector of width `N`.

| Verilog    | Moore Dialect |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `bit`      | `!moore.i1`   |
| `logic`    | `!moore.l1`   |
| `reg`      | `!moore.l1`   |
| `byte`     | `!moore.i8`   |
| `shortint` | `!moore.i16`  |
| `int`      | `!moore.i32`  |
| `integer`  | `!moore.l32`  |
| `longint`  | `!moore.i64`  |
| `time`     | `!moore.l64`  |
