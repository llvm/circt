    Connect and partial connect expansion and canonicalization happen in this

    This inliner pass will inline any instance of module marked as inline, and
    recursively inline all instances inside of a module marked with flatten.
    This pass performs renaming of every entity with a name that is inlined by
    prefixing it with the instance name.  This pass also will remove any module
    which is not reachable from the top level module.

    The inline and flatten annotation attributes are attached to module
    definitions, and they are:

    replicates the return types of the memory operation, and replaces the
    MemoryOp with an instance of the module.  Inside the new module, an
    instance of an FExtModule black box is created.  The black box module must

    pass in the Scala FIRRTL compiler.

    This pass will:
    1. Resolve last connect semantics.
    2. Remove all when operations.

    When a wire has multiple connections, only the final connection is used,
    all previous connections are overwritten. When there is a conditional
    connect, the previous connect is only overwritten when the condition
    holds:

    ```firrtl
    w <= a
    when c :
      w <= b

    ; Equivalent to:
    w <= mux(c, b, a)
    ```

}

def LowerCHIRRTL : Pass<"firrtl-lower-chirrtl", "firrtl::FModuleOp"> {
  let summary = "Infer the memory ports of SeqMem and CombMem";
  let description = [{
      This pass finds the CHIRRTL behavioral memories and their ports, and
      transforms them into standard FIRRTL memory operations.  For each
      `seqmem` or `combmem`, a new memory is created.  For every `memoryport`
      operation using a CHIRRTL memory, a memory port is defined on the
      new standard memory.

      The direction or kind of the port is inferred from how each of the memory
      ports is used in the IR. If a memory port is only written to, it becomes
      a `Write` port.  If a memory port is only read from, it become a `Read`
      port.  If it is used both ways, it becomes a `ReadWrite` port.

      `Write`, `ReadWrite` and combinational `Read` ports are disabled by
      default, but then enabled when the CHIRRTL memory port is declared.
      Sequential `Read` ports have more complicated enable inference:

      1. If a wire or register is used as the index of the memory port, then
         the memory is enabled whenever a non-invalid value is driven to the
         address. 
      2. If a node is used as the index of the memory port, then the memory is
         enabled at the declaration of the node.
      3. In all other cases, the memory is never enabled.

      In the first two cases, they can easily produce a situation where we try
      to enable the memory before it is even declared. This produces a
      compilation error.

    This pass infers whether resets are synchronous or asynchronous, and extends
    reset-less registers with an asynchronous reset based on the following
    annotations:

    - `sifive.enterprise.firrtl.FullAsyncResetAnnotation`

def BlackBoxReader : Pass<"firrtl-blackbox-reader", "CircuitOp"> {
  let summary = "Load source files for black boxes into the IR";
  let description = [{
    This pass handles reads the Verilog source files for black boxes and adds
    them as `sv.verbatim.file` operations into the IR. Later passes can then
    write these files back to disk to ensure that they can be accessed by other
    tools down the line in a well-known location. Supports inline, resource, and
    path annotations for black box source files.

    The supported `firrtl.circuit` annotations are:

    - `{class = "firrtl.transforms.BlackBoxTargetDirAnno", targetDir = "..."}`
      Overrides the target directory into which black box source files are
      emitted.
    - `{class = "firrtl.transforms.BlackBoxResourceFileNameAnno", resourceFileName = "xyz.f"}`
      Specifies the output file name for the list of black box source files that
      is generated as a collateral of the pass.

    The supported `firrtl.extmodule` annotations are:

    - ```
      {
        class = "firrtl.transforms.BlackBoxInlineAnno",
        name = "myfile.v",
        text = "..."
      }
      ```
      Specifies the black box source code (`text`) inline. Generates a file with
      the given `name` in the target directory.
    - ```
      {
        class = "firrtl.transforms.BlackBoxPathAnno",
        path = "myfile.v"
      }
      ```
      Specifies the file `path` as source code for the module. Copies the file
      to the target directory.
    - ```
      {
        class = "firrtl.transforms.BlackBoxResourceAnno",
        resourceId = "myfile.v"
      }
      ```
      Specifies the file `path` as source code for the module. In contrast to
      the `BlackBoxPathAnno`, the file is searched for in the black box resource
      search path. This is a remnant of the Scala origins of FIRRTL. Copies the
      file to the target directory.
