    Some operations in the comb dialect (e.g. `comb.truth_table`) are not
    directly supported by ExportVerilog. They need to be lowered into ops which
    are supported. There are many ways to lower these ops so we do this in a
    separate pass. This also allows the lowered form to participate in
    optimizations like the comb canonicalizers.
