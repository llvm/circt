    Suffixes must be provided in cases where a port is tunneled for both read and
    write accesses, and the suffixes must be different (in this case, the suffixes
    will be appended to the target port name, and thus de-alias the resulting ports).

  let description = [{
    Lower `kanagawa.portref<portref <T>>` to T (i.e. portref resolution).

    We do this by analyzing how a portref is used
    inside a container, and then creating an in- or output port based on that.
    That is:
    - write to `portref<in portref<in, T>>` becomes `out T`
        i.e this container wants to write to an input of another container, hence
        it will produce an output value that will drive that input port.
    - read from `portref<in portref<out, T>>` becomes `in T`
        i.e. this container wants to read from an output of another container,
        hence it will have an input port that will be driven by that output port.
    - write to `portref<out portref<out, T>>` becomes `out T`
        i.e. a port reference inside the module will be driven by a value from
        the outside.
    - read from `portref<out portref<in, T>>` becomes `in T`
        i.e. a port reference inside the module will be driven by a value from
        the outside.

    A benefit of having portref lowering separate from portref tunneling is that
    portref lowering can be done on an `kanagawa.container` granularity, allowing
    for a bit of parallelism in the flow.

  let description = [{
    Recreates `kanagawa.sblock` operations from a CFG. Any `kanagawa.block.attributes`
    operations at the parent operation will be added to the resulting blocks.

    The IR is expected to be in maximal SSA form prior to this pass, given that
    the pass will only inspect the terminator operation of a block for any
    values that are generated within the block. Maximum SSA form thus ensures
    that any value defined within the block is never used outside of the block.

    It is expected that `kanagawa.call` operations have been isolated into
    their own basic blocks before this pass is run. This implies that all
    operations within a block (except for the terminator operation) can be
    statically scheduled with each other.
